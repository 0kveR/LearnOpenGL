# LearnOpenGL

This is my attempt at following the [wonderful guide](https://learnopengl.com/) by Joey de Vries.

Project done in CLion w/ vcpkg. Though (mostly) unrelated, I want to link [this article](https://jessenerio.com/how-to-install-any-c-dependencies-in-clion-on-windows/) for the help setting up vcpkg.
